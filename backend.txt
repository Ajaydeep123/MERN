Express server benefits?
Syntax simple, code Readability is better, req res routing simpler
Secure and fast
Server side logic

Feature	                                Express.js	                                                                Node.js

Usage	                 It is used to build web-apps using approaches and principles of Node.js.	    It is used to build server-side, input-output, event-driven apps.
Level of features      	More features than Node.js.	                                                    Fewer features.
Building Block	        It is built on Node.js.	                                                        It is built on Google’s V8 engine.
Written in	             JavaScript	                                                                C, C++, JavaScript
Framework/Platform	     Framework based on Node.js.	                                                Run-time platform or environment designed for server-side execution of JavaScript.
Controllers	            Controllers are provided.	                                                    Controllers are not provided.

Middleware	            Uses middleware for the arrangement of functions systematically server-side.	Doesn’t use such a provision.
Coding time	            It requires less coding time.	                                                It requires more coding time.


//Middleware ans express.json()

What is Middleware?
It is those methods/functions/operations that are called BETWEEN processing the Request and sending the Response in your application method.

When talking about express.json() think specifically about POST requests (i.e. the .post request object)

You DO NOT NEED express.json() for GET Requests or DELETE Requests.

You NEED express.json() for POST requests, because in  these requests you are sending data (in the form of some data object) to the server 
and you are asking the server to accept or store that data (object), which is enclosed in the body (i.e. req.body)
of that (POST or PUT) Request

Express provides you with middleware to deal with the (incoming) data (object) in the body of the request.

a. express.json() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. 
This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: app.use(express.json());
