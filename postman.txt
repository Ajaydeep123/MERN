example 1 steps:

start the nodemon server: nodemon methods.js
go to postman and send the POST request, it will put name: ajaydeep in user object
then to see it make a GET request in postman
Now make a PATCH by putting some value in body, then send a patch request, which will add age:1000 in user object
Make GET request to see it.
